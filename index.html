    <p class="tagline">The future flies itself.</p>
    <p>observv is an Indian autonomous aircraft manufacturing company building cargo planes to connect India&#39;s vast geography. We&#39;re developing 5-10 tonne capacity aircraft that operate from unprepared airstrips as short as 500-800 meters, creating a new layer of freighter logistics infrastructure across the nation.</p>

    <p>India competes globally in software, pharmaceuticals, and space technology, yet we import every commercial aircraft despite having one of the world&#39;s fastest growing aviation markets. We want to build planes in India.</p>

    <p>We are currently building our PV-01 technology demonstrator, a conventional high-wing monoplane with a single turboprop engine. It features a large cargo door dimensioned for LD3 containers, fixed landing gear for simplified maintenance, and no cockpit section—replaced by an aerodynamically optimized nose housing our sensor suite and avionics.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We build machines to move goods through the sky.</p>

    <p>Our goal is simple: make thousands of planes per month, as cheaply and quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>We measure success when autonomous cargo aircraft become the default choice for moving high-value goods across distances of 300-1500 km—approximately 30% of India&#39;s domestic freight market. This network will be as fundamental to India&#39;s infrastructure as the national highway system was in the early 2000s.</p>
